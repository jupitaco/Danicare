          1. Services Provided – No Medical Care or Advice Talkiatry is not a
          medical group and does not provide medical advice, care, and/or
          treatment. <br />
          Talkiatry provides administrative and management services to
          independent, physician-owned and operated, medical practices. Any
          telemedicine consults obtained through our Platform are provided by
          Providers, including but not limited to Medical Group. <br />
          Talkiatry licensesthe “Talkiatry” brand name to Medical Group and
          other affiliated medical practices that use our Platform to assist in
          the provision of Services. <br />
          Each Talkiatry-branded practice is owned and operated by a licensed
          clinician. <br /> There is no single provider of medical care called
          “Talkiatry.” <br /> Each Talkiatry-branded practice engages a network
          of United States based clinicians who provide clinical telehealth
          services. <br />
          The Providers deliver clinical services via the Platform to their
          patients. <br /> Talkiatry does not provide medical advice or care,
          own or operate the medical practices, employ or in any way supervise
          the clinicians providing medical care, and control over the care
          provided is the sole responsibility of the independent medical
          practices and the Providers they employ. <br /> Services and practices
          may vary across Providers, and patients should contact the Providers
          at Medical Group directly for all questions concerning their medical
          care. <br /> <br />
          2. Not For Emergencies Our Platform and the Services are not for
          medical emergencies or urgent situations. You should not disregard or
          delay seeking medical advice based on anything that appears or does
          not appear on our Platform. <br /> If you believe you are experiencing
          an emergency, call 9-1-1 immediately. <br /> You should seek emergency
          help or follow up care when recommended by a Provider or when
          otherwise needed. You should continue to consult with your primary
          provider and other healthcare professionals as recommended. <br />
          Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare
          provider concerning questions you have regarding a medical condition
          and before stopping, starting, or modifying any treatment. <br />{' '}
          <br />
          3. Risk of Telehealth Services By using the Services, you acknowledge
          the potential risks associated with telehealth services. <br />
          These include but are not limited to the following: information
          transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to
          allow for appropriate medical or health care decision making by the
          Provider; delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to
          failures of electronic equipment; a lack of access to your medical
          records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions
          or other judgment errors;although the electronic systems we use
          incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the
          privacy and security of health information,those protocols could fail
          causing a breach of privacy of your health information. <br /> <br />{' '}

          prescription product is appropriate for you, and the Provider has
          written a prescription. <br />
